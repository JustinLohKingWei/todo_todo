# Justin's AWESOME TODO LIST

This project is my implementation of the todomvc exercise : https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/ . 

The application is written as a react application with a typescript configuration, and performs all functionatilites as a frontend application only. That being said , there is no external backend architecture involved .
